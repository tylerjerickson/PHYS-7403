    "# Getting Started with GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to download Git. Known as open source version control system, Git is a software designed to help groups of people work together on the same code efficiently and effectively. To get started, if you haven't already, download git at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.  Alternatively, GitHub also has a friendlier interface known as GitHub Desktop which will allow you to use Git without have to work through a terminal.  https://desktop.github.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next you'll create a personal GitHub account which you can do at https://github.com/. Once your account is set up you can create a repository by clicking on the button that says \"new\" repositories on the website. (Note that you can also create repositories by using the Desktop app). You should then name your repository with your name and a descriptor for this class because you will be using this repository to share your codes with the instructor and the grader. e.g. John-Doe-QC-Homework.  Initialize a README markdown file and feel free to add a description and choose whether to make it public or private.  If you choose to make it private, make sure the instructors have access as collaborators on the repository. After you press create repository, search for the settings tab within the GitHub view of your repository. The manage access page will allow you to share access to this directory with select individuals. Invite Matt (**mm052118**) and Kaelyn (**kaelynj**) so that they can view your code. \n",

    "GitHub keeps track of your projects through a system of **commits**, a snapshot of all of the changes you've made to a project (adding/deleting files, making changes to your code, etc.) at particular points in time.  Once changes are committed locally on your machine, you can then **push** your commit to your github repository where those changes will be stored online.\n",

    "Test out this process by first cloning your new repository to your machine, making some changes to the README.md file and creating a commit using either the command line or desktop app.\n"
